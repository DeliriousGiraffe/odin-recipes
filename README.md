# odin-recipes
For Recipe project following TheOdinProject

Simple three recipe site using what have learned so far.
Only thing I did not know how to do was create a spaceor new line between a link and the picture.
Something like /n or /nl for "new line".
Looked up a possible solution online but it looked more advanced for such a simple thing.
In the end, I decided to just use a blank paragraph open and close to create the gap between
the links and images on index page.
